# How install

someone wants to clean this up - go for it

- git clone or download the app
- install dependencies via npm
- type npm start to run from your terminal
- See app in local env at localhost: 3000 



## Quick brief

- index.js top level component
- app.js represents the router from which pages are sorted
- create pages under components
- right now you have dashboard (landing page)
- extra page products for now as an example

- check page is working by typing name in url ex: 
  /products

- add your styles for this page under styles with scss (sass)


### Debug

- if for some reason you're not able to work with sass or u get an error: you may need to install node-sass module locally
- other reasons you may have problems getting it working: 
 - make sure you have npm install  (npm -v)
 - make sure you have node install  (check by doing node -v)

### Pushing to github

- git is already installed and remote url is already set, so you just do:
   - download to local machine
   - do git branch and checkout <name of your branch>  (create your working branch)

   - push to repository by doing git push origin <name of your branch>
   (this branch doesn't have to be already in remote and will be created automatically)


>  i'll clean this up later


### Other stuff to do

 - right off top of my head :  global styles
 - i'll be doing redux right now
